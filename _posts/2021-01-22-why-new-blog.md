The last class of my undergraduate career has ended, and my applications for graduate schools have also come to an end. However, every ending is a new beginning. With the passion in my heart, I want to say goodbye to my previous stage by rebuilding my blog and enter a new journey in my life.

In this blog, I plan to use my crappy English and not so proficient Chinese to write down some insights. The recorded content may cover all aspects, but the main part, of course, is still focused on computer science.

Thank you for visiting my blog.
